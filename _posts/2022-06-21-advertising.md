# About external items

> You are on the main library and are viewing an item in our catalogue that is stored in an external collection. The [yEAh Games main library](https://library.yeahgames.net)'s purpose is to provide a medium for regular users to be able to browse through *all* the Archives' content in one place; but, in reality, most of our content catalogue is hosted on external, separate Library collections and are simply embedded onto the main browsable Library. If you're interested, need more information, or something isn't working as intended, we recommend you visit the catalogue item's external host page, linked at the top of this page.
