The [yEAh Games main library](https://library.yeahgames.net)'s purpose is to provide a medium for regular users to be able to browse through *all* the Archives' content in one place; but, in reality, most of our content catalogue is hosted on external, separate Library collections and are simply embedded onto the main browsable Library.
