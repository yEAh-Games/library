<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The following are the official, legal languages of yEAh Games. This does mean that you cannot speak other languages; in fact, it's the opposite: We encourage you to speak your languages, and it's against the law to discriminate against that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Official languages are simply the languages that yEAh Games is built on, and the languages that moderators/developers mainly use in the server. They could also be languages not necessarily used in the server officially, but spoken by parts of the community; and can also be ceremonial official languages, that are rarely used, but are still a part of yEAh Games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most of the server structure/official announcements are done in English; rarely are they also done in other languages. We hope to see them be available in other languages soon.</p>

<h3 id="english">English</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The English language is a language belonging to the Germanic languages branch of the Indo-European language family, widely spoken on six continents. The primary language of the U.S., Britain, Canada, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and various Caribbean and Pacific island nations, it is also an official language of India, the Philippines, and many sub-Saharan African countries. It is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world (approximately 1.5 billion speakers), the mother tongue of more than 350 million people, and the most widely taught foreign language. English relies mainly on word order (usually subject-verb-object) to indicate relationships between words. Written in the Latin alphabet, it is most closely related to Frisian, German, and Dutch. Its history began with the migration of the Jutes, Angles, and Saxons from Germany and Denmark to Britain in the 5th and 6th centuries. The Norman Conquest of 1066 brought many French words into English. Greek and Latin words began to enter it in the 15th century, and Modern English is usually dated from 1500. English easily borrows words from other languages and has coined many new words to reflect advances in technology.</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Spoken by the majority of yEAh Games members, English has become the <em>de facto</em> language of the server and the community as a whole. The majority (if not all) of the announcements in the server are done in English, and the majority of the community speaks English in their day-to-day conversations. The entire server and website were built in English and are still today, but we are hoping to change that.</p>

<h3 id="french">French</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The French language is a romance language spoken as a first language by about 72 million people in France, Belgium, Switzerland, Canada (mainly Quebec), and many other countries and regions formerly governed by France. French is an official language of more than 25 countries. Its earliest written materials date from the 9th century. Regional dialects survive mostly in uneducated rural speech. French grammar has been greatly simplified from Latin. Nouns do not have cases, and masculine and feminine gender are marked not in the noun but in its article or adjective. The verb is conjugated for three persons and for singular and plural; though spelled differently, several of these forms are pronounced identically.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While rarely used in announcements and only sometimes used in day-to-day conversation, French, as the server is based in Canada, is frequently mentioned/discussed, and the majority of members in the server can speak at least the basics of the language. It is important for the cultural value of yEAh Games that French stays an official language, as it is still one of the staples of discussion, especially among members who take French immersion at school.</p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 id="wumilcixupaiata"><strong>Wumilcixupaiata</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>A language composed fully by yEAh Games members, with characters, pronunciations, actual grammar,  sounds that flow together, an alphabet with formal and non-formal letters, and so much more. It was fully developed, around when yEAh Games was created, by yanguage teachers and developers to suit yEAh Games' members and needs. The name was actually the first letters of each country put together, then simplified for easier pronunciation. The language was generally based on the English alphabet, and characters translate literally to characters in English. Depending on the region, certain members may have an accent while speaking this language with proper transitions.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While, again, not actually being used in official announcements, Wumilcixupaiata is more of a ceremonial official language as it was technically the first official language in the server, being developed in a language-making project by members of the server. It is technically the formal official language of yEAh Games, as it is fully developed and understandable, contrary to the informal, mostly-spoken-in-person, Sbalti Gamor Ck'tel; although it is rarely used.</p>

<h3 id="sbalti-gamor-ck-tel">Sbalti Gamor Ck'tel</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Sbalti Gamor Ck'tel is yEAh Games' "Y" language, where a "Y" is added in front of a vowel at the start of the word, or the "Y" replaces the consonant at the start of a word, with some exceptions for hard-to-pronounce words. Mostly used informally between yEAh Games members in-person as a sort of "secret code" or "joke" (although also used semi-frequently on the server), the language originated from a joke when a member started putting "Y"s in front of random words said. Eventually, it was made official and named using a similar tactic as the above one. The language generally does not have any special rules, aside from adding a "y" at the start of a word (or replacing a consonant) and removing other letters (there is not dictionary on what letters should be removed in certain words; it is decided by the community as they use the language) if the word is too hard to pronounce with the new letter.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Again, not used frequently (especially not officially; it is used somewhat often by members both in-person and online), Sbalti Gamor Ck'tel is more of a 'ceremonial' official language because it was designed by members of the server early on. Mostly used informally, the language has become a staple for members, especially founders, when chatting with each other on yEAh Games topics in-person. Because the language can be very hard to understand for non-original speakers (as some words will end up sounding the same when the "Y" is added), it is unlikely to ever be used officially.</p>

<p>While most announcements on the server will continue to be announced in English for a long time to come, we're hoping to eventually allow users to browse the archives, news, server and other yEAh Games media forms in whichever official language they desire. In order to accomplish this goal, we require translators to translate the media into the various languages so they can be accessed; you can apply for this role in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/887052880782176266/959798642737303563">#forms</a> on our Discord server.</p>
