<p><strong>ANNOUNCEMENT:</strong><br>"The school year has ended, and so daily yEAh Games meetups will no longer be happening, and neither will they next year, as everyone is going to different schools. However, to make up for this, the yEAh Administrative team has been planning, for several months, a possibility for another meetup/reunion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The original idea was to host it on September 6th (6/9), but since that's the first day of school, we have decided to not do so. Instead, we might be hosting one either slightly later in the fall or possibly during the summer.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The event will probably be hosted at Agincourt RPS unless someone has another idea, and people can bring games, yEAh Games stuff, just hang around, or do other stuff. We could even host the uncompleted yEAh Game! Anything is on the table.</p>

<p><strong>Please discuss in the attached thread if you have any suggestions.</strong></p>

<p><strong>We also encourage you to vote below on when you think the first meetup should take place (and if you'd show up).</strong><br>You can vote for both, if you feel like we should host both and you would show up. If you vote, you are not stating that you'll show up; rather, you're showing possible interest in the event.</p>
