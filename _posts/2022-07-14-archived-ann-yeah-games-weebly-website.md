<p><strong>ANNOUNCEMENT:</strong><br>"Regardless of what you said, I did it anyway!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The new yEAh Games official website has been -- sort of -- released.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many new features are coming soon, but so far we have:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>The home page</li><li>The Discord server page</li><li>The Discord bots page</li><li>The Wa Wa West + page</li><li>The TOS/Rules page</li><li>The Blog/Announcements page</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>CHECK IT OUT HERE: https://tiny.one/yeahgames</strong><br><strong>Or, at its direct URL, https://yeah-games.weebly.com/</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Feel free to DM @yEAh Games for any questions, concerns, or comments. You can always volunteer to help design and build the website as well.<br>Seriously, though, the website was needed; having everything on the Discord, without being able to see it anywhere else, caused some problems.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>For one, if you needed to see any information about anything yEAh Games-related, you had to go onto the Discord. There was no other option.</li><li>Secondly, as more and more features were added, channels started to appear quite frequently, and eventually started to clutter the server.</li><li>Third, finding information is much easier now, with search features and everything in one spot, without having to go combing through thousands of messages.</li><li>Fourth, this way, nothing can be erased. If someone purposefully or accidentally erases important information in the server, it cannot be retrieved. Having information somewhere else, safe, is a good thing.<br>Also, it's not like the website causes you any harm; I'm the one who's actually managing it.</li></ul>
