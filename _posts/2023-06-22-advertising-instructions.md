## Notes
† : Ads are very rarely rejected, and in the case that they are, it is almost always because the content or target link is illegal. Certain sites on the network may not allow some ads (e.g., NSFW content, or audio), but, generally, most are accepted immediately. See "[Requirements for advertisers](./requirements)" for more information.
