<p><em>Please note that these rules are the <strong>original</strong> official rules; new rules have been put into place since then. See the full lawbook for full details, including for rules outside of the Discord server.</em></p>

<h1 class="has-medium-font-size">Discord rules:</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;Be Kind &amp; Listen to Mods</strong><br>Be kind to each other, this means no harassment, bullying, derogatory name-calling, discrimination of race, colour, gender, sexual orientation, physical or mental ability, religious affiliation, national origin or language barrier. Further, if a mod finds something you are doing to be disrupting the peace of the server, please comply with their request immediately.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2.&nbsp;<strong>No Spam or Promotion/Advertising</strong><br>No spamming or flooding channels. Spam means posting a lot of nonsense/gibberish, and flooding meaning posting the same thing multiple times to fill the screen. Additionally, no promotion or advertising of any kind unless it is within the allowed content types.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>3. Content Guidelines</strong><br>No posting of NSFW content or graphic material. This means no naked, half-naked stuff or violence/gore. Political discussions should be kept limited to none.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>4. No Threats to Others</strong><br>Basic stuff. Be nice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>5. No Mass Pings or Ghost Pings</strong><br>No pinging of any roles or excessive pings of other server members. This includes ghost-pings (pinging someone and deleting it.) Any attempts to "try" a ping @everyone or @here will result in a warning, kick or ban depending on the situation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>6. No Sharing of Personal Info</strong><br>Do not share personal information of yourself or others. This includes name, age, address, email, phone, account access, etc.<br>Hacking Accounts or Seeking Personally Identifiable Information (PII)<br>Attempting to send IP grabber links, cookie loggers or attempting to obtain and share Personally Identifiable Information (PII) will result in a perma-ban without warning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>7. No-to-Little Politics</strong><br>Don't argue or attempt to cause heated discussions about politics. Memes are allowed, though, but please respect others' opinions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>8. No Non-animal Emojis in the #animal-farm channel</strong><br>Posting anything besides an "animal" in this channel can result in an insta-ban. The definition of an animal, in our consensus, can include fantastical creatures as well, even if this is not true. #animal-farm is for only animal emojis!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>9.&nbsp;No swearing and/or profanity</strong><br>While the policy has changed since this rule was originally implemented, the community generally prefers if you aren't, per se, using a swear word once in every message. We can't do anything about it, but we ask that you keep discussions civil and keep swearing to the minimum. Illegal terminology is similar, but you can make your own decisions about the use of terminology vs. regular terms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>10.&nbsp;You know how rules work, so please, follow them.</strong><br>Don't be technical, and attempt to bypass them; you know what not to do. Violating some of these rules will result in a low tier of moderation action, and, if you continue to not follow the rules, you may get perma-banned from our server.</p>
