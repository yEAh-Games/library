# Why am I encountering a 522 error?

Increase in 522 errors since May 2023 We're aware of an issue resulting in the influx of 522 errors across the network. This issue became noticible on certain subdomains starting in late May 2023. It is primarily affecting VPN & automated connections. Our team is actively investigating and working towards a resolution. Read the page below for more information. We apologize for any inconvenience caused and appreciate your patience.

![Example Cloudflare 522 error](522.webp)
*You may occasionaly encounter a `522 Connection Timed Out` error page served by Cloudflare while browsing the network. This can be caused by several things.*

The 522 error code indicates a connection timeout issue when accessing sites on the yEAh Network. This documentation provides a detailed technical overview of the error code and offers troubleshooting steps to resolve the issue.

HTTP `522 Connection Timed Out` error codes represent an error that occurs when a server is unable to establish a timely connection with either the client's browser or another server. This error typically indicates that the server, or an intermediary proxy or firewall, is unable to respond within the specified time limit. It can be caused by various factors, such as server overload, network connectivity issues, or configuration problems. (Read more on [Cloudflare's documentation](https://community.cloudflare.com/t/community-tip-fixing-error-522-connection-timed-out/42325).)


## Technical

The HTTP 522 error code typically occurs on the yEAh Network when accessing sites due to either of the following two reaons:

1. **Interception through the reverse proxy**

   The HTTP 522 error can occur when an IP address, which has been previously blacklisted, is intercepted by the firewall at the reverse proxy (in our case, [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com)†). This interception is intended to protect the yEAh Network's origin server from potential threats or abuse. However, due to a bug with Cloudflare, this interception may lead to the erroneous blocking of access to certain subdomains of the yEAh Network, resulting in the timeout error. It is important to note that this issue should not affect major network services but may occasionally impact less frequently visited sites on the network, especially when using proxies or VPNs.

    Efforts are being made to minimize the occurrence of the HTTP 522 error and provide a seamless browsing experience for all users. However, while the error still occurs, it is advisable to follow the troubleshooting steps outlined below.

2. **Temporary server unavailability**

   In rare cases, the HTTP 522 error can simply be caused by temporary server unavailability. This could be because of a server outage, a configuration issue on our part, or [scheduled maintenance](../../network/status/maintenance) (although `503 Service Unavailable` is usually returned in this case). There is nothing you, as the client, can do to fix 5xx codes (aside from alerting us of the error).
   
   It is always recommended to check the status of the yEAh Network by visiting [status.yeahgames.net](https://status.yeahgames.net) for the latest updates. This resource [provides information](../../network/status/) about any known network issues or scheduled downtime that may affect site accessibility and produce 522 errors between Cloudflare and the server.

## Troubleshooting

To resolve the HTTP 522 error code, try attempting any of the following steps. Please note that if the error is caused by a legitmate *server error*, there is nothing that you, as the client, can do to fix it (please [contact us](mailto:admin+status@yeahgames.net) as soon as possible):

1. **Try disabling your VPN or proxy**

   This is the most common trigger for 522 errors. Try disabling any VPN or proxy service you are using. Certain proxies or VPNs may trigger the interception of blacklisted IPs by the reverse proxy firewall (see "[Technical](#technical)"), leading to the error. 
   
   Note that even if you disable your proxy, the error may still occur because of the same reason. This is most likely because your actual IP address has been blacklisted. A blacklisted IP is almost always not your fault and may be because you inherited it (however, if you are running automatic traffic, like a web crawler or API bot, to Clouflare-proxied sites, you may have caused this issue yourself.) Please contact us to resolve this.

2. **Check your connection**

   Ensure that your network connection is stable and reliable. Confirm that there are no disruptions or network-related issues that could contribute to the HTTP 522 error. Because Cloudflare relies on a reverse connection to the origin, certain countries with limited access to their edge servers may experience this issue more frequently. ([TOR](https://www.torproject.org/) may resolve this issue.)

3. **Clear your cache**

   Clearing your browser's cache and cookies can sometimes resolve unexpected errors. It's always good to check.

4. **Contact support**

   If the issue persists after following the above steps, it is recommended to reach out to the yEAh Network support team for further assistance. You can contact the support team by sending an email to admin@yeahgames.net. Provide the specific details about the error, the troubleshooting steps you have already taken, and any relevant information. We'll investigate the issue and attempt to resolve it out as soon as possible.

Please note that while the yEAh Network team is actively working on resolving the issue, there may be limitations in implementing an immediate fix due to the bug with Cloudflare. Rest assured that efforts are being made to minimize the occurrence of the HTTP 522 error and provide a seamless browsing experience for all users.

We apologize for any inconvenience caused and appreciate your patience as we work towards resolving this issue.
