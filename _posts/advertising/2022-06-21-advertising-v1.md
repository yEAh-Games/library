##### About each type
###### **Banner**
Banner advertisements are advertisements posted horizontally on various parts of a page (only on pages that have a dedicated section banner ads). For example, some websites offer banner advertisements on the header and footer that users will see when they're on that part of the site. These types of advertisements are great for long-term adertising as they'll stay at an accessible part of the website for a long time. These are also perfect for animated ads as they allow lots of room to work with.

###### **Sidebar**
Sidebar advertisements are a traditional type of advertisements, placing a vertical, thin image in the "sidebar" section of a webpage. These can be very easily created and configured for the page, and it will often place it in a visible, easily accessible section where users may click anyways for other widgets. The vertical image is then simply linked to the path of your choice.

###### **Custom post**
Custom post advertisements are a method of creating an actual, complete post (or other form of content) for your advertisement, where you are able to submit content to be displayed in the post; a post is created, temporairly (or permanently, depending on your plan), on the website purely for your advertisement. You can add whatever images, text, and design that you want inside it. Before clicking on the post's content, you'll be able to customize the title, tags, and featured image (if applicable). We also offer "sponsored" posts on certain layouts, which are ads desguised as posts that are linked to the path of your choice.

###### **In-post/page**
In-post or in-page advertisements are usually banner-style ads, that, instead of being added to a standard part of page, like a header, they're added inside a post or a page, in-between various content blocks. These easily catch the users' attention and are great for inexpensive marketing or targeting specific users, instead of the entire site. You can customize which post(s) or post category and where on the posts that you want to display the ad(s).

*Examples of in-post advertisement styles.*

###### **Pop-up**
Pop-up advertisements are great for grabbing users' attention, as they are an image placed in the middle of the screen when a user initiates it (e.g., by navigating to another page). The viewer is guaranteed to notice and be impressioned by the ad, which is why they're great for long-running and short-running advertisements. Note that the availability of this product heavily depends on many variables, including the host of the site, the site itself, and the audience.

We offer custom advertisements as well; contact an agent to setup a design meeting to discuss your idea. Most ideas will be considered. Just bring your idea and how you want to implement it, and leave it to us.
