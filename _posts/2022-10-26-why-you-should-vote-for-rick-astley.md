<p class="has-medium-font-size">The October 2022 yEAh Games elections are upon us. If they were a person, they would be among us. There are four candidates, but only one good candidate. The Official candidates are as follows:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The Rick Astley Party</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The True Canadians Party</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Squatch</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Bro's pro Party</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">But only one candidate sticks out. Rick Astley (real).</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">While the other candidates have no real promises, and, we fear, don't know how to run a discord server. One candidate promises: "funy mems" and that they will have "pro skillz", they don't say that they will do anything. The same premise goes for the bro's pro party.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Squatch stands out only because they threaten you to vote for them, as well as make faux promises, such as, making YEAH flims movies. While spelling yEAh wrong, is one dealbreaker, the other is that everybody know that he won't. He hasn't contributed to a conversation in months, and even the most dedicated of us, Tallinn, hasn't been able to.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">While Rick Astley has sent us a custom music video of his song 'Never Gonna give you up' for the election. The Answer is obvious VOTE4RICK!</p>
