<p><strong>Important note regarding the stock market: </strong><br><em>The stock market is not currently running because of technical difficulties and time restraints. The next report is postponed indefinitely. We hope to eventually restart the market with an automated system, but this will take some time. No other parts of the Yank are affected, and we won't be removing the market any time soon (all previous information can still be viewed), but, for now, we have paused updating share prices and the rest of the market</em>.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>yEAh Games runs a stock market, called the Yock yarket, or 'yonks' for short, where you can invest in different divisions or parts of yEAh Games to make more yoney! Not only are you making yoney though, but you are supporting yEAh Games and its divisions that you love as they will earn profit from the Yank based on the number of stocks sold, and the stock market attracts attention to those divisions. </p>

<p>Reports are published weekly explaining the week's stock news, which companies are doing well, and different graphs for each company. The stock market publishes daily reports on stock prices, and you have twenty-four hours to invest until they change again.</p>

IF YOU ARE FOUND TO BE 'SPAMMING' OR USING AUTOMATED SYSTEMS TO SEND MESSAGES IN ORDER FOR THE STOCK PRICE TO BE RAISED, YOU WILL BE TRIED FOR FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY, WHICH CAN GET YOU PUNISHED AND BANNED. </strong></p>

<h2>Frequently-asked questions (FAQs)</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How are stock prices determined?</strong><br>Share prices are determined by the amount of activity in that division (or in yEAh Games as a whole), using a special formula. If there is more activity, the share price will rise for that divison. The number of shares issued by the company will also change the share price; if there are lots of shares, the prices will be lower; and vice versa.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What is a company's valuation?</strong><br>A company's valuation is the amount of money that the company is worth; it is determined by adding the current price for all the shares that have been sold (it does not include unsold shares.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>When are share prices determined?</strong><br>Share prices are determined at 4:00 PM EST — this means that the messages will be counted then, and any sent after will be counted towards the next day's stock — but prices &amp; graphs may not be released until 5 or 6 PM.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What happens to shares that haven't been sold or were just cashed-out?</strong><br>These shares are called 'nonexistent shares' and won't affect the company's valuation, but are instead held by the Yank — which possesses those shares' profits until they are sold. This protects the stock market from crashing because of fraudulent activity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How do I invest and what does it do?</strong><br>Investing in the yock market is an easy (and one of the few) way(s) to make significant yollars. If you predict that a divison is going to become popular, then you can invest and buy some of its shares from the Yank; then, if the price has gone up, you can sell the shares and make money. You can invest by using the command <code>yeahinvest</code>. You can only invest on what you have in your Yank account; you can take out a loan and get yoney, if you would like; you can exchange your physical yoney for online currency; or you can purchase the yocks in-person.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>When do share prices count?</strong><br>Share prices, when they are determined from 4 to 6 PM EST, are valid until the next close, the next day. This essentially means that a stock, for example, from Monday (after 4-6 PM), is the stock price for most of Tuesday (until 4-6 PM). Any purchasing that happens from the close at 4-6 to the close at 4-6 the next day will use the first day's price.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What is the 'STKMKT:YGSE' stock?</strong><br>This is the added-up value of all the current stocks on the market; it helps to show you how well the stock market is performing as a whole. You cannot invest in this stock (at least, not yet!).</p>
