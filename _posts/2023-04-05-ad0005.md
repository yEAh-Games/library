description: "An archive of all yEAh Encyclopedia pages. After the deprecation of the yEAh Games Encyclopedia (documented on news.yeahgames.net), the yEAh Archive Team decided to ensure the already-published pages weren't lost forever. Includes all media and pages from the Encyclopedia, viewable in Markdown files."
location: archive2
status: complete
notes: "Directory 1 contains the media, while the markdown files contain the pages (with the embedded media) from the encyclopedia."
