# Supported advertisement media
yEAh Ads supports a variety of advertisement media to enhance your advertising experience.

## Media types

1. **Banner Advertisements**: These captivating horizontal ads are placed across supported areas of the website. They are perfect for animated advertisements and can be displayed for an extended period. Banner ads easily attract user attention, although they are only available on certain pages.

2. **Sidebar Advertisements**: This classic vertical ad format is available on most websites. It is easy to set up and offers a standard advertising option. Sidebar ads are known for their good click-through rate and work well for small, short ad placements.

3. **Custom Post Advertisements**: For detailed and immersive ads, our custom post option is the best choice. You can create an entire post or content specifically for your advertisement. This allows you to embed images, text, and designs to engage users. Custom posts are great for long-running advertisements and are supported on websites with posts.

4. **In-Post/Page Advertisements**: These ads are strategically placed within posts or pages, catching the users' attention as they browse through content. In-post/page advertisements are ideal for short-term advertising and using banners to stand out among the content. They are easy to set up and view, targeting specific users or sections of a site.

5. **Pop-Up Advertisements**: When users click a link, pop-up ads appear in the middle of the screen, grabbing their attention instantly. They are great for interactive or animated advertisements and can be effective for both long-running and short-term campaigns. Please note that pop-up availability depends on various factors and requires special consideration.

6. **Custom Options**: If you have a unique advertising idea, talk to our agents, and we'll work with you to bring it to life. We are open to exploring custom solutions to meet your specific requirements.

We continuously innovate and introduce new advertising options to ensure your message reaches the right audience effectively.
