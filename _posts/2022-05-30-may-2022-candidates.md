<p><strong>Campaign promises:</strong> <br>@Binh (Justin), as a registrar of a party, promises to fulfill these promises if they are elected as @Co-owner of yEAh Games: <br>" ⠀<br>1. <strong>Automation of the yEAhconomy</strong> ⠀⠀<br><em>Let the Economy of yEAh Games be automated. If this party is to be re-elected, purchasing/trading yollars will soon be much simpler, with the use of commands.</em> <em>No manual management will be required- all work shall be done by @yEAh.</em> <em>Given enough time, the yEAh Games Stock Market shall be automated as well, updating daily with all calculations done internally.</em> ⠀<br>2. <strong>YeeBot Discs</strong> ⠀⠀<br><em>YeeBot Discs shall be distributed to everyone every now and then in yollars-trading for a fair price.</em> ⠀⠀<em>This may (or may not) provoke a new subeconomy of tradeable, musical goods.</em> <em>Given enough time, more custom YeeBot Discs will be produced, released and distributed as well.</em> ⠀<br>3. <strong>Decoration and Housekeeping</strong><em>⠀⠀</em><br><em>As of now, the virtual home of yEAh Games is, quite frankly, visually unappealing. All 82 channels are grey and boring, and a great majority remains unused.</em> <em> With the re-election of the Proper Pop-Up Purple Paper People's Party, channels will be decorated with a bit more colour, to spice things up. Channels will be renamed to add atmosphere, such as "#church" instead of "book-of-religion". Unused channels will also be archived every now and then.</em> <br>" <br><strong>Brief description (optional):</strong></p>

<p style="font-size:6px;">HARRY BAKER - PAPER PEOPLE</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"6px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:6px;">I like people.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"6px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:6px;">I’d like some paper people.<br>They’d be purple paper people.<br>Maybe pop-up purple paper people.<br>Proper pop-up purple paper people.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"6px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:6px;">“How do you prop up pop-up purple paper people?”<br>I hear you cry. Well I …</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"6px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:6px;">I’d probably prop up proper pop-up purple paper people<br>With a proper pop-up purple people paperclip,<br>But I’d pre-prepare appropriate adhesives as alternatives,<br>A cheeky pack of Blu Tack just in case the paper slipped.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"6px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:6px;">Because I could build a pop-up metropolis.<br>But I wouldn’t wanna deal with all the paper people politics.<br>Paper politicians with their paper-thin policies,<br>Broken promises without appropriate apologies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"6px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:6px;">There’d be a little paper me. And a little paper you.<br>And we could watch paper TV and it would all be pay-per-view.<br>We’d see the poppy paper rappers rap about their paper package<br>Or watch paper people carriers get stuck in paper traffic on the A4. Paper.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"6px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:6px;">There’d be a paper princess Kate but we’d all stare at paper Pippa,<br>And then we’d all live in fear of killer Jack the Paper-Ripper,<br>Because the paper propaganda propagates the people’s prejudices,<br>Papers printing pictures of the photogenic terrorists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"6px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:6px;">A little paper me. And a little paper you.<br>And in a pop-up population people’s problems pop up too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"6px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:6px;">There’d be a pompous paper parliament who remained out of touch,<br>And who ignored the people’s protests about all the paper cuts,<br>Then the peaceful paper protests would get blown to paper pieces,<br>By the confetti cannons manned by pre-emptive police.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"6px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:6px;">And yes there’d still be paper money, so there’d still be paper greed,<br>And the paper piggy bankers pocketing more than they need,<br>Purchasing the potpourri to pepper their paper properties,<br>Others live in poverty and ain’t acknowledged properly.<br>A proper poor economy where so many are proper poor,<br>But while their needs are ignored the money goes to big wars.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"6px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:6px;">Origami armies unfold plans for paper planes<br>And we remain imprisoned in our own paper chains,<br>But the greater shame is that it always seems to stay the same,<br>What changes is who’s in power choosing how to lay the blame,<br>They’re naming names, forgetting these are names of people,<br>Because in the end it all comes down to people.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"6px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:6px;">I like people.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"6px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:6px;">’Cause even when the situation’s dire,<br>It is only ever people who are able to inspire,<br>And on paper, it’s hard to see how we all cope.<br>But in the bottom of Pandora’s box there’s still hope,<br>And I still hope ’cause I believe in people.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"6px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:6px;">People like my grandparents.<br>Who every single day since I was born, have taken time out of their morning to pray for me.<br>That’s 7892 days straight of someone checking I’m okay, and that’s amazing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"6px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:6px;">People like my aunt who puts on plays with prisoners.<br>People who are capable of genuine forgiveness.<br>People like the persecuted Palestinians.<br>People who go out of their way to make your life better, and expect nothing in return.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"6px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:6px;">You see, people have potential to be powerful.<br>Just because the people in power tend to pretend to be victims<br>We don’t need to succumb to that system.<br>And a paper population is no different.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"6px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:6px;">There’s a little paper me. And a little paper you.<br>And in a pop-up population people’s problems pop up too,<br>But even if the whole world fell apart then we’d still make it through.<br>Because we’re people.<br></p>
